		<h2>How Does Someone Use Vocation By Location?</h2>
		<div class="text">
			<p>Vocation By Location is a REST Service. 
			<br>
			<br>The user will need to send HTTP GET requests to use the service. 
			<br>It does not matter what language they use to send these requests. 
			<br>These requests will be secure (https).
			<br>
			<br>The responses from this service will come back as JSON.
			<br>
			<br>No Authentication of any kind is needed to use the service.</p>

			<p>Our service is located here: http://13.58.130.252:8080/ReST_Devs/api/
			<br>From here you can send requests and receive responses to those requests.
			<br>

			<p><span style="font-weight:bold">You Send:</span>
			<br>We provide two endpoints to get the desired results.
			<br>
			<br>1. An HTTP GET request looking for a selected industry.

				<ul>
					<li>minWage - OPTIONAL, minimum industry average wage</li>
					<li>maxWage - OPTIONAL, maximum industry average wage</li>
				</ul>
			<br>2. An HTTP GET request looking for the places where that industry is located.

					<li>industry - REQUIRED, an industry id returned from the previous query</li>
					<li>minPopulation - OPTIONAL, the minimum population of each place</li>

			<br>A session will return a list of JSON objects for each request. 
			<br>
			<br>1. A JSON Object that contains the industry name, the average wage, and its corresponding id.
			<br>
			<br>2. A JSON Object that contains the place name and its corresponding state, and population
