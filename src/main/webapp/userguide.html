		<h2>How Does Someone Use Vocation By Location?</h2>
		<div class="text">
			<p>Vocation By Location is a REST Service. 
			<br>
			<br>The user will need to send HTTP GET requests to use the service. 
			<br>It does not matter what language they use to send these requests. 
			<br>These requests will be secure (https).
			<br>
			<br>The responses from this service will come back as JSON Objects. 
			<br>
			<br>No Authentication of any kind is needed to use the service.</p>

			<p>Our service is located here: <a href=https://datausa.io/>https://ourcompany.com</a>
			<br>From here you can send requests and receive responses to those requests. 
			<br>

			<p><span style="font-weight:bold">You Send:</span>
			<br>A session will need at least two http get requests through our service to get the desired results.			
			<br>
			<br>1. An HTTP GET request looking for a selected industry.
			<br><span style="margin-left: 50px">An http Industry Get Request for the service: (https://ourcompany.com/api/industries)
			<br>
			<br>2. An HTTP GET request looking for the places where that industry is located.
			<br><span style="margin-left: 50px">An http Place Get Request for the service: (https://ourcompany.com/api/places?industry=(industry id))</p>

			<p><span style="font-weight:bold">You Receive:</span>
			<br>A session will return a list of JSON objects for each request. 
			<br>
			<br>1. A JSON Object that contains the industry name, the average wage, and its corresponding id.
			<br><span style="margin-left: 50px">JSON Object returned for Industry: {industry name, average wage, id}.</span>
			<br>
			<br>2. A JSON Object that contains the place name and its corresponding state, and population. 
			<br><span style="margin-left: 50px">JSON Object returned for Place: {place name, companies per 1,000 people, state, population}.</span></p>
