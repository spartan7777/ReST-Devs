			<br>No Authentication of any kind is needed.</p>

			<p>In order to use the service, go to our site located here: <a href=https://datausa.io/>https://ourcompany.com</a>
			<br>Once there, you will be able to send requests and receive responses to those requests.

			<br>2. A JSON Object that contains the location name and its corresponding state, and population.
