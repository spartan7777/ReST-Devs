		<h2>What Is Vocation By Location?</h2>
		<div class="text">
			<p>Vocation by Location provides a geographical concentration data of industries in the US. 
			<br>It is a service designed to help the user find an industry, and then use that indusrty to find locations in the US where that industry is thriving based on population.</p>
			<br>
		</div>

		<h2>How Does Vocation By Location Work?</h2> 
		<div class="text">			
			<p>We provide a URI to process these requests. 
			<br>There are two endpoints for the requests made through our service.
				<ol>
					<li>Industries
					<li>Places
				</ol>	
			 A user sends a request to receive a list of industries. Each industry result that we provide will have an industry name and an id associated with it. 
			<br>The user will then take the id that they have and pass this into the URI from our site. 
			<br>This will get them a list of locations that feature the highest concentrations for that industry in the US.</p>
			<br>
		</div>
			
		<h2>Who Is Vocation By Location Designed For?</h2>
		<div class="text">
			<p>This service is geared towards anyone that would need this kind of data for an application, or a project or even a job search. 
			<br>You just need our site and to have a working knoweldge of how to send an Http request.
