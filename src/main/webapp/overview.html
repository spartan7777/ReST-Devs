		<h2>What Is Vocation By Location?</h2>
		<div class="text">
			<p>Vocation by Location provides a geographical concentration data of industries in the US. 
			<br>It is a service designed to help the user find an industry, and then use that industry to find locations in the US where that industry is thriving based on population.</p>
			<br>
		</div>

		<h2>How Does Vocation By Location Work?</h2> 
		<div class="text">			
			<p>Our service does three things:
				<ol>
					<li>Reaches out to a Service to get the requested data.</li>
					<li>Processes this data to make it more user friendly.</li>
					<li>Brings this back to the user so that they can utilize it.</li>
				</ol>
			<br>We provide a URI to process these requests. 
			<br>There are two paths for the requests made through our service.
				<ul>
					<br><li>Industries: http://13.58.130.252:8080/ReST_Devs/api/industries</li>
					<br>Or<br>
					<br><li>Places: http://13.58.130.252:8080/ReST_Devs/api/places?industry={Some industry id}</li>
				</ul>	
			<br>A user sends a request to receive a list of industries. Each industry result that we provide will have an industry name and an id associated with it. 
			<br>The user will then take the id that they have and pass this into the Places URI from our site as a query parameter. (Please refer to our <a href="userguide.html">User Guide</a> for more info on supported query parameters.)
			<br>This will get them a list of locations that feature that industry in the US.</p>
			<br>
		</div>
			
		<h2>Who Is Vocation By Location Designed For?</h2>
		<div class="text">
			<p>This service is geared towards anyone that would need this kind of data for an application, or a project, or even a job search.
			<br>You just need our site and to have a working knowledge of how to send an Http request.
