# PROJECT NAME: Vocation By Location: Job Search in the US by Industry and City.

## Problem Statement: 
The purpose of this web service is to allow developers to find the major job centers in the US for a given industry. 
Imagine that a developer is creating an app so that a user can easily look up where the highest concentrations of their given 
job industry would be. This information is available, but it is extremely tedious and time-consuming to get it in dev-friendly, 
usable JSON. We have taken care of that process, and will provide a simple, well-documented, no-nonsense API so that the developer 
can get the data they need, and only that data, quickly and efficiently.
